# Development-of-driver-drowsiness-monitoring-system-using-python
This Python-based system uses computer vision and facial landmarks to monitor a driver's eye activity in real-time. By calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), it detects drowsiness and triggers an alarm if the eyes remain closed beyond a safe limit, helping prevent microsleep-related accidents.
# ðŸš— Driver Drowsiness Monitoring System Using Python

A real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision and Python. This project helps to prevent road accidents by alerting drivers when they show signs of drowsiness.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Real-time video stream processing using OpenCV
- Facial landmark detection using dlib
- Calculates Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect eye closure
- Triggers an alarm if drowsiness is detected
- Simple and efficient Python-based implementation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To develop a smart vision-based system that continuously monitors the driver's eye movements and sounds an alert if signs of drowsiness are detected, thereby reducing the risk of accidents.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:**
  - OpenCV
  - dlib
  - imutils
  - scipy
  - playsound or pygame (for alert sound)

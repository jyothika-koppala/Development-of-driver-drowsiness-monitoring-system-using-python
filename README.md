# Development-of-driver-drowsiness-monitoring-system-using-python
This Python-based system uses computer vision and facial landmarks to monitor a driver's eye activity in real-time. By calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), it detects drowsiness and triggers an alarm if the eyes remain closed beyond a safe limit, helping prevent microsleep-related accidents.
